    <!--Note: id is a unique indentifier means if we assign the firstdiv id to an element so this id cannot use again in any thing.
    but classes are works differntly means if we can assign same class to many elememts so it does not effect anything.
    we can also create sub classes in classes like this red bg-yellow in this red is a class or bg-yellow is subclass. 
    and most imprtant things when we target class or id in css we use '#' for id and '.' for class.
    id(#) can also use in html page when someone wants go specific part of the page-->
