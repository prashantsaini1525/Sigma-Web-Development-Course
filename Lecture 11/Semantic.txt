When to Use Each Semantic Tag?
Here’s a logical order for using semantic tags in a webpage:

Start with <header>: Add the title, logo, and navigation.
Use <main>: Structure the core content with <section> and <article>.
Include <aside>: Add sidebars or related links.
Add <footer>: Include closing details like copyright or contact info.
Use <nav> and <figure> inside appropriate sections.
Use <details>, <mark>, <time>, etc., as needed.


What are Semantic Tags?
Semantic tags add meaning to your HTML. They tell both the browser and the developer what kind of content is being presented.

Here are some of the key semantic tags you must know about:

<header>: Used to represent the top section of a web page, often containing headings, logos, and navigation.

<nav>: Signifies a navigation menu on a web page.

<article>: Indicates a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.

<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content on a web page.

<aside>: Typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content.

<footer>: Represents the footer of a web page, usually containing copyright information and contact details.

<figure> and <figcaption>: Used for embedding images, diagrams, or charts, along with a caption.

<main>: Signifies the main content area of a web page.

<time>: Used to represent time-related information, like dates and times.

Key Points to Remember
<section> is for grouping related content within a page or article.
<article> is for self-contained content that can stand on its own.
Use <article> inside <section> for multiple independent pieces grouped together.
Use <section> inside <article> for dividing a single topic into subsections.
Conclusion
There’s no absolute “best” approach—it depends on your content. However:

For news feeds or archives: <article> inside <section> is more common.
For detailed single articles: <section> inside <article> makes more sense.


Easy language to understand:
Maan lo ki koi ek humne "article" tag use kiya hai toh hum uss artical tag ko tabhi use krenge jab woh ek independent article ho example : blog, post, tutorial.

but hum "section" tag ko artical tag ke andar uss artical k sections banane mein kar sakte hain jaise ki ek blog hai toh uss block mein hum section bna sakte hain example: section 1-morning, section 2-afternoon section 3-Evening.

aise hi hum section ke andar artical use kr sakte hain jaise ki humne ek section bnaya section-1 morning toh hum usme "artical" tag use krke ussko describe kar sakte hain.
