        <h1>HI, THIS IS PRASHANT SAINI</h1>
        <p>I'm a upcoming developer</p>
    </div>

    <div id="two">
        <h2>HI, If you are here so you are on right platform.</h2>
        <p>Welocme back hero!!</p>
        <h3>I'm also a Software Developer and learning or enhancing my skills everyday.</h3>

        <h4>So, Why we use id selector basically we used id as a unique id for every element because id should be assigned only once for every individuals. and id should noe be applied twice or more because id isliye hi bnayie jaati hai taaki ek particular chiz ko ek particular id mile.</h4> 
        </h4>
        <p>So, As you see that in this page here i applied Id Selector <mark><strong>(#idname)</strong></mark>
            properties which are applicable for only where we put unique id name for each individual in HTML Page.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="four">
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In the style block, the selector  <mark><strong>#title</strong></mark>, will only target the HTML element having an ID of "title".</p>
    </div>
