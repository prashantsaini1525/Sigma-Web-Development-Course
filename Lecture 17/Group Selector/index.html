        <h1>HI, THIS IS PRASHANT SAINI</h1>
        <p>I'm a upcoming developer</p>

        <p>So, Why we use group selector basically, The group selector is used to minimise the code. <mark><strong>Commas ","</strong></mark> are used to
            separate each selector in a grouping. This reduces the number of lines of code. The code also looks clean.
        </p></p> 

        <p>So, As you see that in this page here i applied Group Selector <mark><strong> (e.g., h1, p,
            .classname)</strong></mark>
            properties which are applicable for which are we selected or targets in CSS Page.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="four">
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In the style block, the group selector <mark><strong> (e.g., h1, p,
            .classname)</strong></mark>, will target any element,tag,class,id etc. in CSS.</p>
